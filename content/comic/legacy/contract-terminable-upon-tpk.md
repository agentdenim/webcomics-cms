            The woman in the maroon dress stands by the window, accompanied by a
            mysterious figure in a black robe. His face and body are completely
            obscured, except for his eyes and one bone-white hand. He has a
            badge stuck to his robe that looks like a nametag, with “GM” written
            on it. “Veronica, that was your fourth total party kill in six
            campaigns,” he says. “You’re a Level 2 damsel in Distress, you don’t
            get to kill PCs.”


            The woman - veronica - crosses her arms, and looks rather sour. “I have a zero tolerance level for that sort of a behavior. I don’t see the problem.”

          transcript: “It’s a problem for us,” GM says. “People are saying this dark
            wizard’s campaign is ‘unfair’.” He raises both hands to make
            quotation marks with his fingers. “We’ve had to retcon several PC
            deaths. Including that party you tossed out the window!”“That
            halfling had it coming for him,” Veronica says, jabbing a finger at
            GM. “And are you really **rewarding** that sort of behavior?”

            GM remains unmoved. He holds out a sealed envelope to Veronica. “In
            light of the current player outcry, we’re going to have to cut you
            from the campaign,”he says. “You’re hereby ordered to collect your
            belongings and vacate the premises **immediately**. You’re also on
            probation until further notice.”


            Veronica looks absolutely furious. “You’re evicting me? **But I live here**!” she says, jabbing her finger downwards as if staking a claim on the tower. “I should get at least **two standard actions**!”
