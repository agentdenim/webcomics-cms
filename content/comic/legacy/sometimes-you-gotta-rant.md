          transcript: Veronica is shown in close-up Her confusion has subsided, and now
            she looks absolutely furious. “Fine! Kick me out! I’m done with the
            damsel in distress gig!” She yells, jabbing a finger upwards in a
            sharp gesture.

          transcript: The panel zooms out, showing the rocks outside the tower and Mr
            Tiny’s head peeking up at Veronica from the bottom. “I am a strong
            and independent NPC and I refuse to be a pawn in someone else’s
            campaign!” Veronica keeps yelling. Her arms are spread wide, while
            she’s looking skywards as if exasperated. “I’m sick of getting tied
            up for 3 sessions, only to have some PC show up and expect me to
            have sex with him as a sign of my appreciation.”

            Victoria’s expression shifts as she rubs her arm, remembering an
            uncomfortable past campaign. “Not to mention that those ropes really
            start to chafe after a while…”\

            Meanwhile, Mr. Tiny looks back to the left, where the tower door is just off-panel.\

            “You know, I don’t think management is listening,” he says. “He shut the door five minutes ago.”
