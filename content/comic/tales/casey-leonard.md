Amphibian.com[http://amphibian.com] is a webcomic that tells the story of frogs who run a technology company. The REALLY interesting about this comic though, is it is done using web technology – so each comic isn’t just a jpeg file on the screen. Everything is done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each character/accessory/etc. in each cell is a separate SVG file that gets positioned with CSS. The speech bubbles are styled p tags, not part of an image.

Seriously guys, as a web developer, what Casey is doing is some pretty awesome, and I highly suggest you check it out!
