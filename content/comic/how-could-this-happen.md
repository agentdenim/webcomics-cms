            Two figures stand if front of a stone archway with a stone railing
            in front of them. The one on the left, a curly red haired man
            wearing red robes, has a frantic expression on his face, his hands
            gripping his hair, as he looks down at something off panel below
            him. "Horbin!" he shouts. Next to him a dark haired women looks
            unimpressed about what is happening off panel. "Eh, he's probably
            fine" she says.

            Far away shot of the lighthouse in the middle of the night. Near the
            top, we can see the two figures from before, looking at the ground
            below them, another figure to their right watching from the
            shadows.  On the ground we see the shadowed form of their companion
            as he yells "Does this look fine to you?!"

            Close up on the dark haired woman, with a black background behind
            him. She is shrugging her shoulders in an unconcerned manner. "If he
            wasn't fine, he wouldn't be talking," she says.

            Close up shop of the wizard, standing next to the open archway of
            the lighthouse, still looking down at his companion, Horbin. "What
            happened!?" he asks.  Below him, and off panel, Horbin dramatically
            yells "I can see my life flashing before my eyes!"

            Horbin, bellow and off panel, is listing of the events in his life
            that are supposedly flashing before his eyes. "Virginal Elvin
            Maidens! Busty Tavern Wenches! All just begging for some hot
            halfling loving!" Veronica, standing to the right of the entrance to
            the lighthouse balcony, is rolling her eyes. "He fell, obviously,"
            she says, answering the red haired man's earlier question.

            Medium shot of the entrance to the balcony's entrance. The wizard is
            mostly still focused on whatever is going on below them on the
            ground. The dark haired woman is mildly surprised by the sudden
            appearance of a third figure to her right, a green skinned half orc
            with large horns protruding from his forehead (although the right
            hand one is partly broken).  He is wearing nothing on the upper half
            of his torso, and he stares down a the scene below, a dismissive
            look on his face. "Wench right," he declares. "Halfling fell."  The
            halfling in question yells back "No shit, Sherlock!" from off panel.
