            A female drow named Akorlara with long white hair holds the arm of a
            surprised and uncomfortable looking male vampire with short hair and
            a long flowing cape.  With a smile, Akorlara says to the vampire,
            "That's a nice looking cape.  It would look even nicer on the floor
            at the foot of my bed."
