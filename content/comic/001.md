  **Panel One**


  Thog approaches a table where Horbin the halfling is currently in a booster
  seat.  Thog waves at Horbin


  **Thog:** Thog is back.


  **Horbin:** . . . and empty handed I see.  Tell me, how hard is it to remember
  that when you go to town to buy supplies, you have to actually buy the
  supplies!?


  **Panel Two**


  Thog sits down at the table with Horbin, nursing a beer.


  **Thog:** Town gone.


  **Horbin:** What do you mean the town is gone? Burned? Looted?


  **Panel Three**


  **Thog:** Thog think beer placed moved. That's why town is gone.


  **Horbin:** (unimpressed) Don't be silly, Thog.  Taverns don't move. People do
