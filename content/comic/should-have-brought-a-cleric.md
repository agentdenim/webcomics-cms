            Horbin lies in the grass with only a side view of his face and upper
            chest visible, looking above him, an annoyed expression on his face.
            He is calling the people above him, a hand raised next to his mouth,
            as if it will help him speak louder.


            “I’m seeing a lot of blood down here while I’m hearing a lot of yammering up there,” he says.

            A zoomed out view of Horbin lying on the ground, he is now no more
            than a dark silhouette on the grassy ground at the foot of a large
            worn down lighthouse, with an attached lighthouse keeper’s house.
            Horbin is the only living being that can be seen, as his companions
            are much farther away above him, off panel.


            “How much blood does a halfling even have?” he asks. “Xavros?” Another pause. “Thog!”

          transcript: >-
            Xavros, Veronica, and Thog stand in front of the right side of the
            stone entryway into the lighthouse, illuminated by the pale yellow
            light of the interior of the lighthouse. Xavros seems exhausted by
            what he knows is to come, with dark shadows under his eyes as he
            looks upwards, brows furrowed. Beside him, Veronica has an almost
            maniacal grin on her face as she looks at the ground below them.
            Thog, who is on Veronica’s other side, is looking at her with a
            curious expression on his face.


            “I knew we should have hired a cleric,” says Xavros, annoyed.

          transcript: >-
            Xavros stands alone, with only the light of the interior of the
            lighthouse visible behind him. His arms are in front of him, as if
            they are propped up on the railing of the lighthouse’s balcony,
            currently off panel. Xavros is leaning forward, yelling to Horbin
            who is somewhere below him.


            “I’m coming, Horbin!” Xavros yells to the halfling below.


            “Heh,” laughs Horbin from off-panel. “Phrasing!”

          transcript: Veronica and Thog stand in the left 2/3rds of the lighthouse’s
            balcony entrance. Behind them, disappearing into the glowing light
            within, is a shadowy outline of Xavros as he hurries away. Veronica
            is looking down, presumably at Horbin below, her brow furrowed, with
            a dark smirk on her face. To the right of Veronica, Thog stands
            beside her, left eyebrow raised, and right hand scratching the back
            of his head, as if considering something.

          transcript: >-
            Veronica stands in front of an all black panel, outlined in white to
            help contrast her from the background. She looks straight ahead,
            eyes wide, a panicked expression on her face as she Thog speaks from
            somewhere to her right, off panel.


            “Thog never seen halfling punted that far by a human” Thog says.

          transcript: >-
            Veronica and Thog stand in front of the right 2/3rds of the
            lighthouse’s balcony entrance. Veronica looks alarmed, and a bit
            guilty, her eyes wide and pupils shrunk. Her shoulders are hunched
            and she is grasping her left arm with her right hand.


            “I” she sutters, “I can explain?”


            Thog has his hands up in front of him in non threatening gestures, eyes wide as he realized he must have been misinterpreted. “Thog not make self clear,” he says.

          transcript: >-
            Thog is in front of an all light blue panel, outlined in white to
            help contrast him. Only his head, neck, and shoulders are visible.
            He is looking to the left, a large smirk on his face.


            “Thog impressed.” he says.
