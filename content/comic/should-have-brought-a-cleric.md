            We see Horbin the halfling laying on grass, glaring above him.  "I'm
            see a lot of blood down hear while I'm hearing a lot of yammering up
            there," he calls out above him.  We do not actually see any blood.

            We pan out to see more of the lighthouse, although not high up
            enough to see where the half-orc, the wizard, and the womean with
            black hair are standing.  Horbin the halfling is a shadow on the
            ground as he continues to call up to his companions. "How much blood
            does a halfling even have? Xavros? Thog!"

            Back near the top of the lighthouse, the wizard, woman, and the half
            orc are standing at the balcony.  The wizard looks frustrated as he
            laments "I knew we should have hired a cleric." Beside him, the
            woman is smiling as she stares down at Horbin, clearly amused by
            what she sees.  Next to her, the half-orc watches her reaction,
            studying her.

            The wizard is standing by himself, illuminated by the light from the
            door.  "I'm coming, Horbin!" he shouts down to his companion.  His
            companion, off panel, is amused by this and says back. "Heh.
            Phrasing!"

            The wizard has left, leaving the dark haired woman and the half-orc
            standing alone on the balcony.  The dark haired woman is still
            smirking, looking down at what happened to the halfling.  She is
            watched by the half orc, who is raising an eyebrow, and has a hand
            behind his head.

            "Thog never seen halfling punted that far by a human" The dark
            haired woman seems shocked and perhaps worried by this sudden
            statement by the half orc.  She stands alone, surrounded by black,
            emphasizing her feelings of dread.

            On the balcony, the dark haired woman, looking surprised and a bit
            worried stutters "I . . I can explain?". Beside her the half-orc,
            Thog, raises his hands to placate her. "Thog not make self clear" he
            says.

            We see a close up view of Thog's face, which takes up the full
            panel. He is smirking. "Thog impressed," he says.
