          transcript: A starless night time sky, with a light pink glow emanating from the
            upper right hand corner of the panel. The figure of a male halfling
            \[Horbin] with a surprised expression on his face is falling from
            the top of the panel, his arms reach above him, off panel. He has
            shaggy dark brown hair with brown eyes. He is wearing a dark blue
            cape and tunic, with blue and brown leather shoulder coverings
            peeking out from the cape. He has black gloves, brown trousers, and
            black boots that almost reach his knees.

            A lighthouse stands at the top of a hill behind a starless night
            time sky. is a stone lighthouse that looks like it is in a state of
            disrepair. An odd purple glow emanates from a crystal at the top of
            the lighthouse, which was the source of the pink glow in the
            previous panels. Below the floor with the crystal, is an observation
            balcony that circles around the entire circumference of the
            lighthouse. At the foot of the lighthouse stands the lighthouse
            keeper’s house, a smaller, off-white building with a red roof, in a
            similar state of neglect as the rest of the lighthouse.


            On the left hand side of the balcony, a human figure with long hair, barely illuminated by the glow of the door behind them, stands staring down at a shadowed figure falling below them in the shape of the halfling. Horbin is screaming, indicated by a white handwritten font that follows his trajectory saying “Ahhhhhhhhhh!” At the center of the observation balcony, behind the figure near the door, stands another larger figure with horns that watches the scene unfold before them.

          transcript: Horbin is lying on grass covered ground, his limbs splayed out in
            every direction. He’s cringing with his eyes closed. A white
            handwritten font to the side of his head says “Ow.” Somewhere off
            panel and above Horbin, someone says “Shit.”

            A woman \[Veronica] stands looking over a grey stone balcony,
            backlit by a yellow glow emanating from beyond a stone archway.
            Veronica has long black hair that goes halfway down her back, with
            two lighter streams on either side of her face. She has dark brown
            eyes, and dark eyebrows, that are raised with a surprised
            expression. She’s wearing a brown corset over a white blouse. Part
            of a red skirt can be seen peeking out from behind the railing of
            the balcony.Veronica stands in front of an all black panel, outlined
            in white to help contrast her from the background. She looks
            straight ahead, eyes wide, a panicked expression on her face.




            “I’m going to be in so much trouble,” she says.


            “I did not think that would actually work,” she says, looking down at something below her.
