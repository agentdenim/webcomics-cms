            A nighttime sky, nothing can be seen, beyond a pink glow in the
            upper right hand corner of the screen.

            A nighttime sky, with the figure of a halfling with a surprised
            expression falling backwards from the top of the panel. He has short
            brown hair that his blowing across his face, with a dark blue cloak.
            His hands reach out above him and off the panel.

            A nighttime sky, the halfling continues to fall, now about halfway
            down the panel.

            A night time sky. The halfling is near the bottom of the panel. He
            seems aware of the ground below him now, and his eyes start to look
            at his approaching doom.

            Far away shot of a lighthouse on a hill. It is a stone lighthouse
            that looks like it is in a state of disrepair. An odd purple glow
            emanates from a crystal a the top of the  lighthouse, which was the
            source of the purple glow in the previous panels. Below the floor
            with the crystal, is an observation balcony.  A figure, barely
            illimunated by the glow of the door behind them, stands staring down
            at the shadowed figure of the halfling falling bellow them, having
            traversed about half the distance from the balcony to the ground,
            who has started to scream.  Behind the figure watching on the
            balcony, another larger figure with horns watches the scene unfold
            before them.

            The halfling is lying on the ground, cringing, and limbs splayed
            out, his eyes closed. Off panel and above, seemingly far away,
            someone says, "Shit."

            Close up to the entrance of the balcony of the lighthouse, which is
            a stone archway illuminated by yellow light coming from inside the
            lighthouse. A woman with long dark hair looks down off the balcony,
            a look of surprise on her face. "I did not think that would actually
            work," she says.
        - panel: /assets/images/wenches-001-h.jpg
          transcript: >-
            Off panel someone says "Did someone scream?"  This seams to make the
            woman realize the potential consequences of whatever just happen,
            and she stares forward in worry, saying "I'm gonna be in so much
            trouble." Below her, a voice weakly calls out "Guys? A little help?
