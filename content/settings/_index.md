Hey there, traveler! Here at Tavern Wenches, we understand that the way the comics are presented on the internet aren't always the most accessible, and we've done a few things to try and accommodate for that:

## Descriptive Alt Text for Comic Panels

We are currently in the process of adding descriptive alt text for each panel of the comic so a screen reader can read the contents of the comic.

Currently all of the main comic has descriptive alt text for each panel. The wenches are hard at work to add this functionality to the Legacy/Tales comics.

## Closed Caption Mode for Comic

In addition to descriptive alt text, the main comic also supports "Closed Caption Mode," for readers who find difficulty reading the font/font size presented in comic panels.  In this mode, a reader is presented with a large text version of the comic.
  
While we've set up a default font/font-size for this feature, we understand you may prefer something different. Further down this page you'll be able to select your preferred font/font-size for "Closed Caption Mode", as well as indicate if you prefer comics to be set to Close Caption Mode by default on your device. You can also toggle this mode by clicking on the `CC` icon next to the comic title.
