Today's update is [20 comics from the original Tavern Wenches archive](/comic/legacy/) making the current number of legacy comics available to 40 of 115*ish*.

Unfortunately the pen for the tablet I use to make my comic went on the fritz this week. Due to the state of the world right now, getting a replacement has been a bit troublesome, and I need to wait for a new one to get shipped to me. If everything works out, it should be here Friday. To make up for the lack of new comic, I'll be making a few original Tavern Wenches archive updates throughout the week, starting with today's 20 comics.

I hope all of you are staying safe out there. I know my friends and I have been finding ways to play our favorite tabletop games online as we practice social distancing. 

Enjoy, and Stay Safe!
