Lots of things to discuss on today's Rumors from the Tavern!

**First:** as the title of this update suggests, Tavern Wenches is now on [Webtoons](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/tavern-wenches/list?title_no=511037) and [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/Tavern-Wenches/info)! The updates on there are a little behind on what is currently on the website, but it will be catching up in the weeks to come.

**Second**: This has been the case for awhile, but I realized I hadn't actually announced this on the site, but the full original archive [is now uploaded to the site](https://tavern-wenches.com/comic/legacy/)!  The new Tavern Wenches definitely takes inspiration from aspects of that original run, but as some of you may have noticed, it is definitely taking its own path.  I'm still in the process of uploading transcripts of the original legacy comics, but for now you can enjoy the archive as it was originally presented.

**Third:** I have a [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/b006f726f0e0/tavern-wenches)! If subscription to Webtoons/Tapas isn't for you, and you want an easy way of being notified when the comic has been updated or get the latest Tavern Wenches news, [subscribe today](https://mailchi.mp/b006f726f0e0/tavern-wenches)!

**Finally,** I want to give a shout out to all of you who have joined us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/friskycomics)! I haven't really been promoting my Patreon all that much, as my focus has been more on just getting the comic done and tweaking the parts of my site that needed attention, but in the months to come I hope to expand the content there.  Currently becoming a Patreon lets you see behind the scene previews of comics and early access to the comic for the Honorary Wenches tier. In the future I would like to add a Discord server, additional character sheets of the characters [in systems other than D&D 5e](https://tavern-wenches.com/character/horbin/), and bring back the return of the ["What Not to Say to a Wench"](https://tavern-wenches.com/comic/legacy/what-not-to-say-to-a-wench-3/) comics.

Thank you everyone for the likes/comments over the years. Tavern Wenches is near and dear to my heart, and I've loved being able to finally focus on it again in 2020 and bring it back to its former glory (and beyond!)

May the dice always be in your favor!\
