I am currently in the process of bringing back the [old Tavern Wenches archive](/comic/legacy/). Moving from the old site to the new site has been a bit of a process, since the old site was a Wordpress site, and the new one is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site I built from scratch. As a result, I'll be uploading the old archive in chunks over the next several weeks.

On a related topic, if you're interested in seeing what the theme of this site more or less looks like, you can find it on [my Github](https://github.com/sfrisk/webcomics-cms/), along with a few content examples from launch day. I'm also working on writing some tutorials on how I did everything, which you can find at my account on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sarahfrisk).

Happy Gaming!
